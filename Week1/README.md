# Week-1 Assignments

For Week-1 you have to complete 3 assignments in total

1. **NumPy assignment** : You will be given a series of tasks to complete in the NumPy_Assignment.py file. Each task will involve using Numpy functions to perform specific operations on the given data. Read the comments in the script for instructions on each task. 

2. **Matplotlib and pandas** : You are given three exercises which will warmup you plotting skills.

3. **Gradient descent** :In this task, you are given a mathematical function, and your goal is to find its minimum using the gradient descent optimization algorithm. Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm commonly used for finding the minimum of a function. This is a very fun assignment which gives you the idea of gradient descent in depth. Search about this method and learn to solve this. In case you have any doubts you can always contact us!

# Resources

## Python basics

Python will be used primarily for coding throughout this project. For this project, we shall use Jupyter Notebook; you can also use Google Colab if you don't want any installations. You can ask any of us if you face any issue with Jupyter or Colab. 

While an in-depth knowledge of the language is not required, understanding basic data types, data structures, loops, functions, and file operations is essential. We will start with Python and its interesting libraries:

## Colab Notebooks

We will majorly be using colab notebooks for coding exercises. It allows to run the code cell by cell which is really helpful in debugging. It's a hosted Jupyter notebook service with free access to computing resources. Learn the basics of Colab with this [introduction guide](https://youtu.be/iMlMfrXJYSg?feature=shared).
